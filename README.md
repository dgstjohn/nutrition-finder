# Nutrition Finder (to be retitled at some point)

A web application that allows users to search on a wide range of food-related terms (ingredients, finished dishes, and even fast food offerings by name -- e.g., Big Mac) and have related data returned from the NutritionIX.com database, as well as related images where available from the Foodish database.

The application's page utilizes the Materialize CSS framework for CSS design and styling, and employs native JavaScript to return the results and insert them onto the HTML page.
